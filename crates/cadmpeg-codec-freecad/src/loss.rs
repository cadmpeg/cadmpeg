//! Stable loss vocabulary for `FreeCAD` `.fcstd` decoding and writing.

//! Every fallback, approximation, and drop the codec reports carries a

//! surface: harness oracles and downstream tooling key on them, never on the

//! and a new drop path without a code does not compile.

//! [`FreecadLossCode::note`] is the single practical construction path for a
