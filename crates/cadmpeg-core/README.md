# cadmpeg-core

`cadmpeg-core` supplies bounded byte decoding primitives and resource
policy shared by cadmpeg format codecs. Format crates depend on it for
checked cursors, little- and big-endian readers, decode arenas, address-space
views, container summaries, and `CodecError`.

Application code usually depends on a format crate such as
`cadmpeg-codec-f3d` or `cadmpeg-ir`. This crate is for codec authors.

## Install

```sh
cargo add cadmpeg-core
```
