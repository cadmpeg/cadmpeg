//! Stable loss vocabulary for Fusion `.f3d` decoding and writing.
//!
//! Every fallback, approximation, and drop the codec reports carries a stable
//! machine-readable code from [`F3dLossCode`]. Codes are the gating surface:
//! harness oracles and downstream tooling key on them, never on the
//! human-readable message text, so a reworded message is not a contract change
//! and a new drop path without a code does not compile.
//!
//! [`F3dLossCode::note`] is the single practical construction path for a
//! [`LossNote`] in this crate: it fixes the loss category and severity from
//! the code so the two cannot drift apart across sites, and it leaves only
//! the per-instance message to the caller. Local codes appear on
//! [`LossNote::code`] under the `f3d` namespace.
