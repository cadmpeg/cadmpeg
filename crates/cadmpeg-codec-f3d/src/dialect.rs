//! F3D dialect identity: which registry row a Fusion archive is, and how it was
//! admitted.
//!
//! The `*LossCode` template: the enum is internal, registry-generated
//! [`DialectId`] constants are the boundary, `F3dDialect::matched` is the one
//! construction path, and the vocabulary is closed.
//!
//! # Two grammars, one enum, and one recovery row
//!
//! A Fusion ZIP takes one of two document-wide parse strategies, chosen before
//! anything semantic is read (`crate::container::scan`):
//!
//! - A root `Manifest.dat` selects the binary top-level manifest grammar. The
//!   version field selects nothing: every readable version is parsed with the
//!   `3-2-0-0` layout, whose anchors (`FusionDocType`, `.f3d`, and two
//!   hyphenated GUIDs) decide whether that layout fits. A document that
//!   declares `3-2-0-0` and parses is `f3d:manifest-3-2-0-0`. A document that
//!   declares another version and still parses is `f3d:unknown`, read with a
//!   strategy its own declaration does not name.
//! - No root `Manifest.dat`, but `Manifest.json`, `DesignDescription.json`, and
//!   a root-level `*.f3d` member, selects the F3Z multi-document grammar. That
//!   branch reads no version field at all, so `f3d:f3z-multi-document` is an
//!   identity row with an unbounded interior.
//!
//! The two identity rows are [`Admission::Admitted`]: each is parsed with the
//! strategy its own row declares. [`F3dDialect::Unknown`] is the mandatory
//! totality row and it is
//! [`Admission::Unverified`], using `f3d:manifest-3-2-0-0` as the
//! strategy applied to it, with [`dialect_loss`] charging
//! `source.dialect-unverified` on exactly that admission. Refusal stays
//! structural: a manifest whose bytes do not fit the anchors is refused by
//! `crate::manifest::parse_top_level`, and no version is on an allowlist.
