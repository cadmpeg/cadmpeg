# cadmpeg-codec-f3d

`cadmpeg-codec-f3d` decodes Autodesk Fusion `.f3d` archives into `CadIr` and
encodes supported `CadIr` documents back to `.f3d`. The codec covers ZIP
container metadata, ASM B-rep topology, analytic and cached NURBS geometry,
body transforms, design and sketch records, construction history, and
appearances. Multi-document `.f3z` archives decode into one merged document.

Support: L4 ([ladder](https://github.com/cadmpeg/cadmpeg/blob/main/docs/format-support.md#fusion-360-f3d)).

## Install

```sh
cargo add cadmpeg-codec-f3d cadmpeg-ir
```

## Decode

```rust,no_run
use cadmpeg_codec_f3d::F3dCodec;
use cadmpeg_ir::{Codec, DecodeOptions};
use std::fs::File;

fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    let mut input = File::open("part.f3d")?;
    let result = F3dCodec.decode(&mut input, &DecodeOptions::default())?;

    for loss in &result.report().losses {
        eprintln!("{:?}: {}", loss.severity, loss.message);
    }
    println!("{} bodies", result.ir().model.bodies.len());
    Ok(())
}
```

The result holds the decoded `CadIr` and a `DecodeReport`. Read
`report.losses` before trusting geometry. Set
`DecodeOptions::container_only` for archive metadata without B-rep decoding.
`F3dCodec::inspect` returns classified ZIP entries and B-rep header facts.

## Encode

```rust,no_run
use cadmpeg_codec_f3d::F3dCodec;
use cadmpeg_ir::codec::write::{EncodeInput, Encoder, TargetRequest};
use cadmpeg_ir::{Codec, DecodeOptions};
use std::fs::File;

fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    let mut input = File::open("part.f3d")?;
    let result = F3dCodec.decode(&mut input, &DecodeOptions::default())?;

    // Edit supported fields in result.ir().

    let mut output = File::create("part-edited.f3d")?;
    F3dCodec
        .plan(
            EncodeInput::new(result.ir(), Some(result.source_fidelity())),
            TargetRequest::Inherit,
        )?
        .write_to(&mut output)?;
    Ok(())
}
```

Decode retains the source archive and a semantic baseline. Encoding with the
retained `source_fidelity` sidecar replays an unchanged archive byte for byte
and patches supported edits in place. Encoding `CadIr` without that sidecar
writes a canonical archive for the supported source-less profile.

## Data model

The Design body map selects every B-rep blob that contributes bodies.
Extension does not choose the model: `.smb` and `.smbh` are both ASM streams.
History streams are selected independently by the ASM header flag, and every
selected history graph is decoded. Without body-map bindings, a unique
history-bearing stream or a single BREP is the only fallback. The decoder
frames each selected SAB slice and builds each topology chain from bodies
through vertices and points. ASM model-space lengths become millimetres in
`CadIr`. Directions, ratios, angles, knots, weights, and UV parameters keep
their native scale.

Typed transfer covers analytic carriers, cached NURBS, selected procedural
definitions, design and sketch records, typed ASM history, source attributes,
and Protein appearances. Records that block faithful transfer land in
`DecodeReport::losses`. Useful passthrough carrier bytes stay as
`UnknownRecord` values. Failed SAB framing or geometry decoding still returns
container metadata and retained source data, with blocking geometry and
topology losses.
