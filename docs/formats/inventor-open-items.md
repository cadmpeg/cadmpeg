# Autodesk Inventor IPT/IAM: Open Items

This document lists unknown Inventor byte semantics. [inventor.md](inventor.md) contains the settled format model.

## 1. RSe selection and metadata

### RS-01. Multiple coherent databases

**Question.** Which typed field selects one database when several `V<n>/RSeDb` streams have schema 31 but differ in identity or save state?

**Known.** The storage-band number and database schema are independent. The decoder parses all database candidates and requires one coherent registry grammar.

**Need.** We must select one database without using path order or a save-version string.

### RS-02. Metadata sections 5 and 6

**Question.** What item grammar and discriminator semantics apply to metadata sections 5 and 6?

**Known.** The backward spans establish their exact ranges and their join to section 4.

**Need.** We must type their records and references.

### RS-03. Section 7 long item form

**Question.** What fields select and define the section 7 item form whose item width is at least 76 bytes?

**Known.** The short section 7 form uses 32-byte items. Both forms have exact backward-framed ranges.

**Need.** We must validate the long item sequence without accepting arbitrary payload widths.

## 2. Kernel ownership

### KE-01. Multiple part carriers

**Question.** Which typed ownership and history references select the active model when a part contains more than one `PmBRep` segment or kernel-carrier record?

**Known.** The supported envelope has one `PmBRep` segment and one typed kernel-carrier record. Carrier signatures do not establish ownership.

**Need.** We must select active and historical carriers without appending all geometry.

### KE-02. Binary ACIS records

**Question.** What binary ACIS record grammar applies after the `ACIS BinaryFile` header?

**Known.** The Inventor record envelope and exact carrier range are defined.

**Need.** The grammar belongs in `cadmpeg-asm` so direct and embedded decode use one implementation.

## 3. Product structure

### AS-01. Local prototypes and parent records

**Question.** Which record families define embedded local prototypes and parent-child placement inside one document?

**Known.** A `UFRxDoc` occurrence joins its external reference through the exact file-reference identifier and joins `AmDc` and `AmGraphics` through the exact occurrence identifier. Current-document external occurrences are root placements. A referenced assembly remains one unresolved external prototype because the codec does not load it. External-reference state bit `0x2000` marks a suppressed occurrence.

The schema-15 representation/model-state branch and its occurrence table are framed exactly. Unsupported property and export tags stop semantic transfer without inventing a record boundary.

**Need.** We must establish local component definitions and parent links from typed records before emitting non-root or local-prototype occurrences.

### AS-02. Transform units and exceptional branches

**Question.** What semantics apply to non-active placement branches, scale, mirrored state, and singular matrices?

**Known.** The active `AmGraphics` branch stores a compact finite 4-by-4 transform and joins it to an `AmDc` occurrence by exact identifier. Placement translations use centimetres and are converted to neutral millimetres. No field in the external-reference prefix supplies an active placement.

**Need.** We must type the exceptional branches before transferring their scale, reflection, or singular-transform semantics.

## 4. Materials and design intent

### MA-01. Additional face appearance styles

**Question.** Which `PmGraphics` or `FBAttribute` style families bind a Protein appearance asset, texture, or non-diffuse presentation channel to a face?

**Known.** The `PmApp` document-default record selects one rendering-style record by a carrier-local one-based record reference. The rendering style stores the Protein asset GUID and asset-library identifier. Their unique catalog join supplies the default appearance for every part body. A PmGraphics face joins a transferred ASM face through the shared nonnegative Design key. Its object-style collection can select one primary-color style whose second RGBA vector is a direct diffuse face override. The face override has precedence over the body default.

**Need.** Each additional style family requires an exact owner path, channel semantics, and precedence before transfer.

### DE-01. Design record graph

**Question.** Which typed records define parameter identity, sketches, constraints, history order, feature operands, suppression, and result-body transitions?

**Known.** Exact RSe frames provide type identifiers, record ranges, and carrier-qualified identities.

**Need.** Each neutral feature requires complete operation semantics and ordered operands.

## 5. Adjacent envelopes

### EN-01. Other CFB and RSe versions

**Question.** Which RSe schema, metadata, record-trailer, and carrier variants accompany CFB version 4 or metadata versions other than 8?

**Known.** The compound reader admits valid CFB version 3 and 4 containers. The Inventor semantic envelope is schema 31 and metadata version 8.

**Need.** Each governing variant requires a separate finite support envelope.

### EN-02. Drawing and presentation documents

**Question.** Which segment families and records authoritatively identify and define IDW and IPN document semantics?

**Known.** Property metadata can name drawing and presentation kinds. Their semantic decode is not part of the IPT/IAM envelope.

**Need.** Future family support must extend the Inventor codec without treating these documents as parts or assemblies.
